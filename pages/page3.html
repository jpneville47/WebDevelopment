          Introduction

        <p>
          Regional air travel in Northern Canada plays a foundational role in maintaining social and economic
          connections between rural communities, often composed of a high percentage of indigenous peoples [1], and the
          rest of the nation. During the Covid-19 pandemic the Government of Canada established a $75-million funding
          program, meant to last a period of 6-months, to support small air carrier flights to remote communities,
          highlighting the flights’ role in providing “essential goods, services, and access in and out of the
          community” [2]. This program underscores both the way the flights impact daily life and the cost needed to
          maintain this method of transportation when economies of scale are no longer available. However, while the
          pandemic may have placed a spotlight on this need the precarious position of small regional flights in
          Northern Canada has been playing out over many years, with major airlines continuing to consolidate flights or
          eliminate them all together [3].

          <br><br>As society makes the shift to a green energy economy it is important to ensure that the chosen
          solutions allow for continued access to transportation by vulnerable communities. This entails developing
          reduced carbon architectures for aircraft that maintain an achievable price point for their customers. When
          focusing on serving communities in Northern Canada Turbo Prop airplanes, such as the De Havilland Canada Dash
          8 and the ATR 72, form the backbone for regional flights. A global study by The International Council on Clean
          Transportation found that the CO2 intensity for both the Dash 8 and the ATR 72 was just over 125 grams of CO2
          per Revenue Passenger Kilometer (RPK) in 2019 [4].

          <br><br>Focusing on turboprop flights to areas with a high percentage of indigenous people will ensure that
          the proposed energy solution is designed with the vulnerable indigenous communities as the primary customers.
          An overview of indigenous peoples in Canada, from the Annual Report to Parliament in 2020, shows that the
          highest percentage of indigenous people live in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, with 86% and 51%
          percent of their populations being made of indigenous peoples respectively [1]. By cross-referencing the
          census data with publicly available flight data, flights to these regions which employ turboprop aircraft can
          be identified. Three flights of interest were chosen based on the diversity of population, indigenous
          percentage, and flight distance.

        <p>
          <br>Current data from Google Flights shows that the chosen routes range in cost from $300 USD to almost $700
          USD for a one way ticket to the destination [5]–[7]. There are many factors which influence the cost of a
          flight with the propulsion system and fuel production being one part of a larger whole. With the adpotion of a
          new technology in an established market place equivalent or greater utility must be delivered to the consumer
          for adoption to be viable. Often it is the role of governements to ensure that the long term effects of
          decisions which affect society are appropriately regulated and taxed to incentivize a positive outcome. It is
          important for the proposed solution to strike a balance between the cost, utility, and emissions that a new
          technology brings to consumers the assurance that it is having the intended effect.

          <br><br>This report aims to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a hydrogen combustion propulsion system
          on short-haul routes in rural Canada. In addition to the feasibility assessment, various metrics like the
          efficiency of the proposed transportation, cost of operation, and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions will
          be quantified. The report will limit its scope by focusing on the range of operation for the hydrogen
          combustion aircraft to the three cities stated above to understand the adoption of this new technology on
          indigenous communities and how the technology will allow those populations to reduce their carbon impact while
          maintaining attainable costs and utility to the communities.
