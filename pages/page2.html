                <p>
                    51 billon tons of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere every year [1]. In 2015 the
                    United Nations launched Mission Innovation, a global effort to accelerate the development of green
                    energy technologies, which developed the following 5 classifications for greenhouse gas emissions:

                <p>
                    <br>16% (8.16 billion tons) of total global emissions are attributed to the transportation industry
                    of which 30% (2.448 billion tons) are from medium and heavy-duty trucks (MDV/HDV). The proportion of
                    emission attributed to MDV and HDV is projected to rise to 41% by 2060 according to the
                    International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) [2].

                    <br><br>To reduce emissions and fight climate change, technologies must be developed and implemented
                    in the transportation system on a global scale while maintaining profitability and increasing the
                    reliability of the vehicles. Implementation of hydrogen fuel cell technologies in different vehicles
                    is an option for reducing emissions if the process for producing hydrogen becomes cleaner and more
                    efficient. Methods like hydrogen synthesis by light are very promising [43]. In this study the
                    implementation of hydrogen fuel cell technology for semi-trucks is explored using a 1-dimensional
                    physics model of the vehicle. Parameters were developed to match the vehicle application and a
                    control algorithm was implemented to optimize efficiency.

                    Needs and Benefits
                </h1>
                <p>
                    As the transportation industry addresses the problem of climate change they must do so while
                    maintaining the ability to transport goods throughout the world. This means that any solution that
                    is identified must conform to the demands of the industry.

                    <br><br>To show the needs, benefits, and opportunity areas of hydrogen fuel cells key parameters for
                    industry and environment are compared for diesel, battery, and hydrogen fuel cells for class 8
                    semi-trucks. The data shown in the charts below has been aggregated from several different
                    references found during the investigation process to draw conclusions about the general trends in
                    the powertrain composition for our application.

                    <br><br>Emissions must be reduced to fight climate change and regulators are responding by
                    tightening the requirements on the trucking industry with the goal of achieving zero emissions. This
                    would result in a 5% reduction of global emissions each year. The chart below [3] illustrates a
                    proposed path for reducing the emissions for the transportation sector by 2050. However, the goal of
                    reducing transportation emissions by 85% from 2020 to 2050 cannot be achieved without a significant
                    contribution from the trucking industry. Those contributions will come from efficiency & emissions
                    improvements, compliance improvements and zero-emissions technologies as shown in the chart below.

                    <br><br>Payload capacity is crucial for the trucking industry. Its profitability depends on how much
                    the truck can transport. Current diesel class 8 trucks can transport a payload up to 28000 kg. The
                    chart below comes from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [6] and shows the gross
                    weight distribution from a study ran for class 8 semi-trucks; it can be observed a vehicle
                    supporting a payload of 73,000 [lbs.] would satisfy the needs of 90% of the industry.

                    <br><br>Regulations for class 8 vehicles limit the total gross weight to 36,000 [kg]. This hard cap
                    on weight means that every kilogram added to the powertrain takes away a kilogram that could be
                    transporting goods and making a profit. The next plot from the Department of Energy (DOE) shows a
                    breakdown of the tractor weight [8]:

                    <br><br>The average weight of a diesel semi-truck's tractor is 8000 [kg]. From the plot above the
                    diesel powertrain weights 1900 [kg] (4100 [lbs.]). The rest of the tractor's weight is 5800 [kg],
                    this will be a constant during the comparison of different power systems, Diesel, battery, and fuel
                    cell + battery. Payload data from battery was taken from the article â€œQuantifying the Economic Case
                    for Electric Semi-Trucks" [9] where a full battery powered vehicle with a range of 500 miles and
                    1000 [kWh] battery with an estimated payload capacity of 16 - 19 tons (14500 - 17000 [kg]). A middle
                    value was considered for the plot below 16000 [kg]. For fuel cell truck payload comes from the
                    Daimler website in an article about its fuel cell GenH2 truck with a payload capacity of 25 tons
                    (22500 [kg]) and a range of 620 miles [10].

                    <br><br>In terms of range the average annual distance traveled by a class 8 truck for the first five
                    years of operation is 100,000 miles and the annual average mileage for the semi-truck in the United
                    States is 75,000 miles [4]. Based on the analysis of the operational cost of trucking from 2017, 40%
                    are known to travel between 100-500 miles, with another 40% traveling greater than 500 miles [5].
                    The National Renewable Energy Laboratory also conducted a study where 70 trucks were monitored for
                    1150 days and tracked several significant factors. The plot bellow shows the distance traveled vs
                    average speed and number of days on the road [6].
